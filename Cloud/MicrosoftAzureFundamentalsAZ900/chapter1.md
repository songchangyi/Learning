# Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing

## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers. 
You only pay for what you use. The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider. 
Some example providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.

### Cloud computing services
#### Compute power
VMs aren't the only computing choice - there are two other popular options: 
containers and serverless computing.
- Containers

Containers provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for applications. 
They're similar to VMs except they don't require a guest operating system.

The open-source project, Docker, is one of the leading platforms for managing containers.

- Serverless computing

Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, 
configuring, or maintaining a server. 
The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered 
by some action.

#### Storage
The advantage to using cloud-based data storage is you can scale to meet your needs.

> Summary
> Every business has different needs and requirements. 
Cloud computing is flexible and cost-efficient, which can be beneficial to every business, 
whether it's a small start-up or a large enterprise.
