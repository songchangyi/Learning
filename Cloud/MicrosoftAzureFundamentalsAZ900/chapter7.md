# Core Cloud Services - Azure data storage options

## How Azure data storage can meet your business storage needs

#### Azure SQL Database
Azure SQL Database is a relational database as a service (DaaS) based on the latest stable version of 
the Microsoft SQL Server database engine.

#### Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service.
 It supports schema-less data that lets you build highly responsive and Always 
 On applications to support constantly changing data.

#### Azure Blob storage
Azure Blob Storage is unstructured, 
meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold.

#### Azure Data Lake Storage
The Data Lake feature allows you to perform analytics on your data usage and prepare reports. 
Data Lake is a large repository that stores both structured and unstructured data.

#### Azure Files
Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via 
the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. 
Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, 
Linux, and macOS.

#### Azure Queue
Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that 
can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

#### Disk Storage
Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications, and other services to access and 
use as they need, similar to how they would in on-premises scenarios. 
Disk storage allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.

#### Storage tiers
Azure offers three storage tiers for blob object storage:
1. Hot storage tier: optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
2. Cool storage tier: optimized for data that are infrequently accessed and stored for 
at least 30 days.
3. Archive storage tier: for data that are rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days 
with flexible latency requirements.

#### Encryption and replication
- Encryption for storage services
- Replication for storage availability
