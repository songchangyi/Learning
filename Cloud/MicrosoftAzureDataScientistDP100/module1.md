# 1 Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

## 1.1 Getting started with Azure Machine Learning

### 1.1.1 What is Azure Machine Learning?
Azure Machine Learning is a platform for operating machine learning workloads in the cloud.

Built on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, Azure Machine Learning enables you to manage:
- Scalable on-demand compute for machine learning workloads.
- Data storage and connectivity to ingest data from a wide range sources.
- Machine learning workflow orchestration to automate model training, deployment, and management processes.
- Model registration and management, so you can track multiple versions of models and the data on which they were trained.
- Metrics and monitoring for training experiments, datasets, and published services.
- Model deployment for real-time and batch inferencing.
