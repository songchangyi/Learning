# Modeling

## 6.1 Introduction

## 6.2 Concepts
### Model
Trying to figure out a mathematical formula.

Data, Algorithm, Computation, Feedback => model => generalization

### Developing a good model
1. What type of generalization are we seeking
2. Do we really need ML
3. How will ML generalization be consumed
4. What do wa have to work with
5. How can I tell if the generalization is working
