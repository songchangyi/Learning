# Rank Scores

## Description
Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. 
Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. 
In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):
```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

## Optimal solution
- Code
```
SELECT
    Score,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Score) FROM Scores WHERE s.Score <= Score) Rank
FROM
    Scores s
ORDER BY 
    Score DESC
;
```
