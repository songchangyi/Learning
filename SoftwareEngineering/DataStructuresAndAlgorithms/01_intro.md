# Introduction

### Definition of Data Structure
A DS is a way of organizing data => use effectively

### Abstract Data Types vs. DS
ADT is the interface which a DS must adhere to => no specific details

Examples :
- List vs. Dynamic Array, Linked List
- Queue vs. Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue
- Map vs. Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table

### Complexity Analysis
- time
- space

### Big-O Notation
Gives an upper bound of the complexity in the <b>worst</b> case. Helping to quantify performance.

Examples :
- O(1), O(logn), O(n), O(nlogn), O(n^2), O(n^3), O(b^n), O(n!)
