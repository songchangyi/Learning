# Lesson 1 : Overview of A/B Testing

## 1. Introduction to Course

## 2. Course Format
- Overview
- Example
  - Choose a metric
  - Review statistics
  - Design
  - Analyze

## 3. Intro to A/B Testing
A general methodology used online when testing a new product or a feature. 
You can take 2 sets of users, show one set a control set (existing product or feature), and another set the new version. 

## 6. Other Techniques
- user experience research
- focus groups
- surveys
- human evaluation

## 7. History of A/B Testing
Hypotheses testing

A consistent response from your control and your experiment group

Robust and repeatable result

## 8. Overview of business example
- Customer funnel
- Experiment : change orange to pink will increase how many students explore Audacity courses

## 9. Metric Choice
- Total number of courses completed : too much time X
- Number of clicks : percentage X
- Nb of clicks / Nb of page views : CTR (Click-through rate) X
- unique visitors click / unique visitors to page : CTP (Click-through probability) Y

## 10. Estimating CTP
Rate for usability, Probability for total impact

## 12. Which distribution
Binomial

## 14. Confidence Intervals
To use normal : N * min(p, (1-p)) > 5

z_score = +1.96 or -1.96

z_score table : https://www.math.upenn.edu/~chhays/zscoretable.pdf

## 16. Establishing Statistical Significance

## 17. Null and Alternative Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis or H0 : Pcont = Pexp

Alternative Hypothesis or HA : reject null if p < 0.05

### Two-tailed tests
- A statistically significant positive result
- A statistically significant negative result
- No statistically significant difference.

### One-tailed tests
- A statistically significant positive result
- No statistically significant result

## 18. Comparing Two Samples
