# Markov Decision Processes (MDP)

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Markov Decision Processes

### Understand Markov Decision Processes, or MDPs

### Describe how the dynamics of an MDP are defined

### Understand the graphical representation of a Markov Decision Process

### Explain how many diverse processes can be written in terms of the MDP framework

## Lesson 2: Goal of Reinforcement Learning

### Describe how rewards relate to the goal of an agent

### Understand episodes and identify episodic tasks

## Lesson 3: Continuing Tasks

### Formulate returns for continuing tasks using discounting

### Describe how returns at successive time steps are related to each other

### Understand when to formalize a task as episodic or continuing
